Data extractions from two sources (DBpedia and GeoNames) via a SPARQL endpoint and an API, respectively, and their integration in .ttl / .rdf format.

Construction of an RDFS ontology and reasoning with RDFS, followed by querying the RDF database with varied queries that integrate information from the two combined datasets.
